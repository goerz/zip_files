Command line utilities for creating zip files.

Provides the ``zip-files`` and ``zip-folder`` command line utilities. These are
intended as an easy platform-independent tool to create zip files with
an arbitrary file name and an arbitrary root (the top-level folder after
extracting a zip) from files and folders at arbitrary locations on the file
system.

Typical usage includes:

*   Deploy zip archives of Sphinx-documentation while releasing Python packages:

    .. code-block:: shell

        zip-folder --auto-root --outfile docs/_build/artifacts/mypackage-v1.0.0.zip docs/_build/html

    creates a file ``mypackage-v1.0.0.zip`` in ``docs/_build/artifacts`` that
    unzips as a folder ``mypackage-v1.0.0`` containing the files originally in
    ``docs/_build/html/``.

*   Create zip files pulled together from different locations, for emailing:

    .. code-block:: shell

        zip-files -a -o report.zip ./report2020-01.tex /scratch/project/plots/*.pdf

    creates a file ``report.zip`` that unzips as a folder
    ``report`` containing the file ``report2020-01.tex`` and all the pdf files
    originally in ``/scratch/project/plots/``.

    .. code-block:: shell

        zip-files -f report2020-01 -o report.zip ./report2020-01.tex /scratch/project/plots/*.pdf

    does the same, but unzips as a folder ``report2020-01`` instead of ``report``.



Development of zip-files happens on `Github`_.


Installation
------------

To install the latest released version of zip-files, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install zip_files

This is the preferred method to install zip-files, as it will always install
the most recent stable release.  It will result in the executable commands
``zip-files`` and ``zip-folder`` being added to your environment's ``bin``
folder.

                                      methods are available: "stored": no
                                      compression; "deflated": the standard zip
                                      compression method; "bzip2": BZIP2
                                      compression method (part of the zip standard
                                      since 2001); "lzma": LZMA compression method

      -a, --auto-root                 If given in combination with --outfile, use
                                      the stem of the OUTFILE (without path and
